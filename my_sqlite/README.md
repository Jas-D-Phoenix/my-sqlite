# Welcome to My Sqlite
***

## Task
The task is to create a class called MySqliteRequest in my_sqlite_request.rb which should have similar behavior to a request on the real sqlite.
The challenge is to create it in such a way that all methods, except run, will return an instance of my_sqlite_request.

## Description
This project involves the creation of a Ruby class called MySqliteRequest and
a Command Line Interface (CLI) program for interacting with a simulated SQLite database.  
The CLI program is a user interface for the MySqliteRequest class, it accepts SQL-like commands and allows users to interact with the database,
execute queries, and perform various database operations.
Users can issue SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries, specify tables, add conditions, and perform JOIN operations.
The program provides options to save and load the database from files.

## Installation
Users will have to useSELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries, specify tables, add conditions, and perform JOIN operations.
e.g. SELECT * FROM students

## Usage
This project can be used for the purpose of updating, deleting, inserting new data, and selecting data from the given csv file.
To use it, be sure to avoid adding .db to the file name otherwise you will get an error. e.g. do not use students.db instead,
use students.
